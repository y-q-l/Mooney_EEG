This repository provides Matlab scripts for our work presented in:

Y. Lu, W. Singer (2021) Dynamic signatures of the Eureka effect: An EEG study.

This study used our customized scripts and the Matlab toolbox FieldTrip (https://www.fieldtriptoolbox.org/). 

EEG-templates are from or derived from the templates used in FieldTrip.
